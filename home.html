                        <p class="text">Hi I'm Julie. My journey into development actually started some time ago, but it is only recently that I have thought more seriously about it as a career.</p>
                        <h3 class="worktitle">How it all started</h3>

                        <p class="text2">I actually started my career in law before moving into training as an accountant. After studying my undergraduate degree at University College London I then transitioned into studying for professional legal qualifications with the aim of becoming a solicitor (the GDL and the LPC). After completing both, as I was working in tax law at Thomson Reuters at the time, I decided to take the leap and study to become an accountant which would be more applicable to a career in tax and as I have always considered myself to be stronger in numeracy and problem solving than languages.</p>
                        <p class="text2">With this in mind, I undertook the ICAS qualification (chartered accountancy qualification) and worked whilst doing this at one of the big four firms EY. Although I am glad to have taken the journey that I have and been fortunate to learn a lot about tax and finance through my studies I still craved something more intellectually challenging and creative.</p>


                        <p class="text2">I started coding as a hobby as I really enjoyed the challenge of teaching myself something challenging from scratch and learning how different aspects of the code fit together in different frameworks. I loved the problem solving aspect of learning to code and seeing some of my ideas come to fruition. It is something that while a struggle at the beginning I found came to me fairly naturally, particularly as I was learning python which is so logical and intuitive.</p>
                        <p class="text2">In the earlier days of learning code, I focused solely on python and built things that stretched me mentally, such as building a sudoku which involved coming up with the sudoku generator algorithm and a lot of lateral thinking and focus to understand the relationship between the numbers on the board. More recently I have started to move onto programming more practical commercial projects including a website for a cafe business which is built in Django. For further details of the technical skills I have, these are listed under the skills section of this site.</p>
                        <p class="text2">I have now learned four languages Python, Javascript, HTML and CSS and two web frameworks, Flask and Django. I would love to work in a role which utilises all of my previous skills, law, finance and coding and would be particularly interested in a developer job with a financial aspect.</p>
                        <img src="/static/jogging.jpg" alt="" style='width:100%; border: solid white 2px;'>


                        <h3 class="worktitle">Because it's not all about work...</h3>
                        <p class="text2">When I am not working I love being outdoors and doing exercise. One of my main passions in life is climbing. Before the lockdown I was a regular at a lot of the indoor climbing centres around London including the Arch and Vauxwall - which was my local where mostly I bouldered (a form of climbing that does not use ropes or harnesses). I am also part of a BMC group and have loved going on weekends away to climb outside (which does involve ropes and mostly trad climbing).</p>

                        <p class="text2">I also love cycling, especially around London as I feel that it has been a great way to get to know the city better despite being a fully-fledged Londoner who has lived in London for ten years. I also have recently got into running and ran a half marathon before Christmas in Victoria Park. I am currently training for a marathon, which due to Covid has been postponed until next year. I also have a passion for music and love playing my guitars.</p>
                        <p class="text2">I consider myself fairly social generally and love getting to know people. If you like what you see and would be interested in working with me, I'd love to hear from you. &#128578;</p>

                    <div class="cafe_div">
                        <h6>Cafe Website</h6>
                        <p class="text3">My most recent project has been building an e-commerce website for a cafe in Django. Above you can see a small video of the home page, using HTML and CSS for the front end. I have used techniques such as template inheritance to stick to DRY coding principles for the header and footers to ensure style consistency. The CSS layout is mobile responsive.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="video">
                        <video width="100%" height="240" controls>

                        </video>
                    </div>

                    <p class="text3">Above you can see the accounts and login page. You can register as a new customer and login to the site using Form Models in Django. The page will create a User object when a user is created in the back-end which can be viewed in the admin function and the user will be authenticated if the correct login details are provided when logging in. The pop-up boxes were created in Javascript.</p>

                  <video width="100%" height="240" controls>
                        <source src={{ url_for('static', filename="Store.mov") }} type="video/mp4">
                        Your browser does not support the video tag.
                    </video>

                  <p class="text3">The functionality for this is mainly using python. I have created different models to handle the cart functionality and used functions to manipulate the data, when an item is added to the cart a new cart object is created in the cart class for example.</p>


                    <video width="100%" height="240" controls>
                        <source src={{ url_for('static', filename="Cart.mov") }} type="video/mp4">

                    </video>

                  <p class="text3">Some of the functionality for the cart and the store is in Javascript and some is in Python.</p>

                    </video>

                  <p class="text3">To take payment, I have integrated PayPal's code into the site.</p>

                    <div class="sudoku_div">
                        <h6 class="project2">Sudoku</h6>
                        <p class="text3">Below is a sudoku built in Javascript using Django. The front-end also uses HTML and CSS. Prior to this I built a similar version in Python using pygame.</p>
                    </div>

                  <video width="100%" height="240" controls>
                        <source src={{ url_for('static', filename="sudoku.mov") }} type="video/mp4">
                        Your browser does not support the video tag.
                    </video>

                    <p class="text3">The sudoku generator works by looking at the patterns on the board. For example, you know that the numbers in the first three boxes can only be on the second or third rows. If you take those three numbers and put them in the same order on the second row and and on the third and then use the same principle with the other numbers you can populate the board.</p>
                    <p class="text3">However, the board is not randomised enough at this point to be a sudoku board. You can then twist the ends like you would a rubiks cube provided that you make the corresponding twists in the right places across the board so that the pattern remains you then have a randomised sudoku board without having to do anything too complicated. It's then just a case of removing the numbers to create the board and checking whether the user inputs the correct values.</p>
                    <p class="text3">I have created an easy, medium and hard level by just adjusting the number of digits initially shown on the board in my function. As you can see from the video there is also a check function that will tell the user if they have made a mistake on the board. </p>
                    <p class="text3">I deployed the site to python anywhere and a link can be found here: <a href="http://treemaryjulie.pythonanywhere.com/">Click Me!</a></p>

                        <p class="text3">Whilst learning to code I built a number of smaller desktop applications in Tkinter and pygame including a music player, virtual piano, regex tester and a pixel art thief game. The full code for which can be found on my Github page. This website is built using Flask, Python, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.</p>
